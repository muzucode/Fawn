Fawn SM (Fawn Server Management)

Edge proxy server (EPS) listens, acting as the API
Upstream servers (US) are listening for messages from EPS
Client sends request to EPS
EPS routes HTTP to correct US
EPS SSHs into each server
US running its own Gin client

EPS has one gin servers running
  - Receive request from user, then route that request to US
    and return the US response to the user


User Request ----> EPS ----------------> US ---------------------> EPS -------------------------> User
=========================  proxy to  ==========  respond to  ============  proxy response to  === 


message appears on a port-specific region on the plane

---------------------
Order of operations:
Load server information from database
Create Servers
Create SSH connections to USs
Set each IOStream to a separate file

Design:
Many environments
  Environment has servers
